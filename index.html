        <p>Turn over any two cards. <br>
            Match the social and emotional learning (SEL) term with its example. To play: turn over any two cards. If the term and the example match, you keep the cards. If they donâ€™t, the cards turn back over and you can try again. Remember where each card was so when you turn over another two cards, you can find the matches.
